# belly-button-challenge

# Completed the following Steps:
#   Used the D3 library to read in "samples.json" from the URL

#   Made a horizontal bar chart with a dropdown menu to display the top 10 OTU's
#       set up the values, labels, and hovertext for the chart (samples_values
#       otu_ids and otu_labels)

#   Created a bubble chart that displays each sample:
#       "otu_ids"(x values and marker colors), "sample_values"(y values and
#       marker size), "otu_labels"(text values)

#   Displayed the sample metadata and individual demo info:
#       Looped through each key-value pair from the JSON object and created a 
#       string
#       Appended an html tag with the text onto "#sample-metadata" panel

#   Updated all the plots for when a new sample is selected
